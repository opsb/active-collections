Introduction
------------
ActiveCollections is an attempt to create a java API that behaves similarly to the ActiveRecord in rails. It sits on top of JPA so you can map your objects as usual with annotations. It allows you to easily create repositories for each of your JPA classes and then filter methods to query these. As a bonus the repositories implement the Set interface so that you can drop them in anywhere a Set can go.

Install
-------
Update your maven settings with

    <dependency>
        <groupId>opsb</groupId>
        <artifactId>active-collections</artifactId>
        <version>0.18</version>
    </dependency>

Usage
-----
Got an Article object with JPA mappings? Let's create an active set for it.

    public class Articles extends JpaActiveSet<Article> {
  
        public Articles() {} // Required for cglib - transactions etc.
  
        public Articles(EntityManagerFactory emf) {
            super(Article.class, emf);
        }
  
    }


### Hook up to the db
    Articles articles = new Articles(entityManagerFactory);

### Saving articles
    Article article = new Article("Sir Ian McKellen: Cowboys and Hobbits");
    articles.add(article);

### Count
    1 == articles.total();
    1 == articles.size(); // Takes paging into account to conform to Set contract i.e. pagesize determines maximum possible result from this method. Normally you'll want to use total().
    false == articles.isEmpty();
    
### Exists?
    true == articles.contains(article);
    false == articles.containsAll(collectionOfArticles);
    
### Deleting articles
    articles.remove(article);
    articles.removeAll(collectionOfArticles);

### For loops

    for(Article article : articles) {
      System.out.println(article.getName());
    }

### Used in place of a Set
    Set<Article> setOfArticles = articles;
All methods of the Set interface have been implemented so your Articles can go anywhere a normal Set can.

### Find
    Article foundUsingId = articles.find(article.getId())
    articles.find(idForArticleThatDoesntExist) // throws IllegalArgumentException
    null == articles.findOrNull(idForArticleThatDoesntExist)

### Paging
    Articles firstPage = articles.page(1); // default page size is 25, indexed from 1
    Articles smallerPageSize = articles.pagesOf(10).page(1);

### Sorting
    Articles sortedByName = articles.orderedBy("name DESC");

### Chaining
Notice that many of these methods return an object of type Articles. This allows us to chain them together.

    Articles orderedByNamePageOne = articles.orderedBy("name DESC").pagesOf(20).page(1)

### Filtering
active-collections allows you to define custom filtering criteria, let's extend our Articles implementation. We're going to take advantage of the where(jpaFragment, param1, param2, ...) method. JpaActiveSet makes an alias available for you so that you can just refer to the entity easily. The convention is that the alias is the lowercase name of the entity, in this example "article".

    public class Articles extends JpaActiveSet<Article> {

        public Articles() {} // Required for cglib - transactions etc.

        public Articles(EntityManagerFactory emf) {
            super(Article.class, emf);
        }
    
        public Articles beginningWith(String startOfName) {
            return where("article.name like ?", startOfName + "%");
        }
    
        public Articles endingWith(String endOfName) {
            return where("article.name like ?", "%" + endOfName);
        }
        
        public Articles publishedBetween(Date startDate, Date endDate) {
            return where("article.publishedDate between ? and ?", startDate, endDate);
        }

    }

now we can do

    Articles articlesWithNamesBeginningWithPEndingWithE = articles.beginningWith("P").endingWith("e");
    Articles q3Articles = articles.publishedBetween(JULY,OCTOBER);

Note that you can add as many conditions as you like and then just chain them up. Why not try it in a for loop

    for(Article article : articles.beginningWith("P").endingWith("e")) {
      ...
    }

#### Joins
Perhaps you want to include conditions on associated entities.

	public class Articles {
		
		...
		
	    public Articles withTag(String tagName) {
	      return join("article.tags tag").where("tag.name = ?", tagName);
	    }
    
    }
    
   	Set<Article> newsAboutIphone = articles.withTag("iphone");
    
You can also use other JpaActiveSets as criteria
	
	public class Articles {
	 	
	 	...
	 	
	    public Articles where(Tags tags) {
	        return join("article.tags tag").where(tags);
	    }
	    
    }
    
	Set<Article> articlesWithTagsBegin = articles.where(tags.like("B%"));

#### Custom select
Maybe you only want distinct entities.

    public Articles distinct() {
      return select("distinct article");
    }
  
#### Default conditions  
You want your articles to be always ordered by title?

    public Articles always() {
      return orderedBy("article.title ASC");
    }  
  
Now when you do

    for(Article article : articles) {
        System.out.println(article.getTitle());
    }
  
or with a condition

    for(Article article : articles.publishedToday()) {
      System.out.println(article.getTitle());
    }
  
They'll be listed alphabetical order
  
#### Distinct
Distinct is actually already available on JpaActiveSet

    articles.distinct();

#### all/none
sometimes you want to return all/none depending on a condition

    public Articles publishedSince(Date startDate) {
      if (startDate == null) return all();
      ...
    }
    
    public Articles inCategories(Set<Category> categories) {
      if (categories == null || categories.isEmpty()) return none();
      ...
    }
    
#### Query for a property
Often you don't want to bring back the whole object and just want a property

    public List<String> allTitles() {
      return this.<String>reduceToList("title");
    }
   
now

    for(String title : articles.allTitles()) {
      System.out.println(title);
    }
    
#### Max value
You can get the max value for a property using

    public Integer getMaxAge() {
    	return this.<Integer>max("age");	
    }
    
or perhaps

	public Long getMaxId() {
		return this.<Long>max("id");
	}
    
will print all article titles without incurring the cost of loading the Article objects.    


#### Dates and Calendars as parameters
They just work. You don't have to worry about telling JPA that they are time based parameters, JpaActiveSet takes care of it for you.

    public Articles publishedSince(Date startDate) {
      return where("startDate > ?", startDate);
    }
    
    public Articles publishedSince(Calendar startDate) {
      return where("startDate > ?", startDate);
    }

#### Collections as parameters using ?
They also just work. JPA will not normally allow you to use Collections as parameters when you're using the ? syntax. It does however work with named parameters. Behind the scenes JpaActiveSet actually converts all ?s into named parameters so you're able to use Collections as parameters with the ? syntax.

    public Articles withAny(Set<Tag> tags) {
      return where("article.tag in (?)", tags);
    }

### JpaActiveSets are proxies onto database tables ###
If you've been checking your log you'll find that a call such as 

    Articles orderedByNamePageOne = articles.orderedBy("name DESC").pagesOf(20).page(1)
    
doesn't actually query the database. The query isn't triggered until you try and use the articles in the Set. 

    for(Article article : orderedByNamePageOne) {
      System.out.println(article.getName());
    }
    
Once you do this you'll see that the query is made to the database. So what's triggering it? To understand that you need to know how the for loop works. When the for loop is compiled it actually get's converted into something like this.

    Iterator<Article> iter = orderedByNamePageOne.iterator();
    while(iter.hasNext()) {
      Article article = iter.next();
      
      // body of for loop
      System.out.println(article.getName());      
      // end of for loop body
    }
    
It's the call to .iterator() is what triggers the query to the database. Each time .iterator() is called the database is queried again. All of the querying methods on a JpaActiveSet behave in the same way. It's important to understand this, consider the following.

    Articles filtered = articles.beginningWith("P").publishedThisWeek();
    
    0 == filtered.total();
    0 == articles.total();
    
    articles.add(articlePublishedThisWeekBeginningWithP);
    1 == filtered.total();
    1 == articles.total();
    
    articles.add(articlePublishedLastWeek);
    1 == filtered.total();
    2 == articles.total();
    
The filtered set always contains all of the articles that match it's criteria.

### Freezing
Perhaps you want to freeze the results for the current request? These are for you.

    Set<Article> frozenSet = articles.frozen();
    List<Article> frozenList = articles.frozenList();
    SortedSet<Article> frozenSortedSet = articles.frozenSortedSet();
    Set<Article> orderedSet = articles.frozenOrderedSet();

### Logging
The logging framework is log4j. By setting the logger level for opsb.activecollections.JpaActiveSet you can view the jpa queries as they're executed.

Sometimes you only want logging from one of your JpaActiveSets. Taking Articles as an example

    import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
    public Articles extends JpaActiveSet<Article> {
  
        //...
  
        @Override
        protected Logger getLogger() {
            return Logger.getLogger(Articles.class);
        }
	
    }

now when you switch on logging for Articles you'll see all of the JPA queries that JpaActiveSet is executing.
  
### Testing    
#### Mocking JpaActiveSets for testing
Mockito is your friend here, it allows you to do "deep stubbing". This means you can define expectations for chains in one go.

    Articles mockArticles = deepMock(Articles.class);
    when(mockArticles.publishedBetween(startDate,endDate).beginningWith("P").frozen())
      .thenReturn(asSet(article1, article2));

and this is the implementation for the deepMock method

    public class MockitoUtil {
        public static <T> T deepMock(Class<T> clazz) {
                return Mockito.mock(clazz, new DeepAnswer());
        }
    }

    class DeepAnswer implements Answer<Object> {
        private static final long serialVersionUID = -6926328908792880098L;

        private final HashMap<Class<?>, Object> mocks = new HashMap<Class<?>, Object>();

        public Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {
            Class<?> clz = invocation.getMethod().getReturnType();
            if (clz.isPrimitive()) {
                    return null;
            }
            if (mocks.containsKey(clz)) {
                    return mocks.get(clz);
            } else {
                    Object mock = Mockito.mock(clz, this);
                    mocks.put(clz, mock);
                    return mock;
            }
        }
    }  
  
### Gotchas
#### Dependencies missing after filtering
When chaining you need to ensure that any dependencies are copied across to the new copy that get's created(each chained method call results in a new JpaActiveSet being created). Here's an example, note how authors are copied across. 

    public Articles extends JpaActiveSet<Article> {
        
        private Authors authors;
        
        public Articles() {}
        public Articles(EntityManagerFactory emf, Authors authors) {
          super(Article.class, emf);
          this.authors = authors;
        }
      
        @Override
        protected <E extends JpaActiveSet<T>> void afterCopy(E copy) {
          copy.authors = authors;
        }
        
    }

#### AOP advice lost in chains
When you chain calls with a JpaActiveSet it creates a new clone of the class for each step. Because these clones aren't managed by spring they don't have any aop functionality mixed in. JpaTemplate is used for all queries though so queries will still be run inside transactions. 

Load time weaving - the solution to this issue is to use load time weaving. Once you've configured this in spring all of the objects in a chain will have the correct aop advice.
  
### TODO - pretty self explanatory though
    Articles distinctArticles = articles.distinct();
    Articles articlesInList = articles.in(asList(article1, article2))
